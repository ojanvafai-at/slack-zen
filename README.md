# slack-zen

Slack is impossible to get away from. You could theoretically close slack to
keep it out of your face. But even when you decide to do focused work, it often
involves messaging a teammate, at which point you are inundated with red badges
on channels, bold channel names, red favicon badge in the browser tab strip.

The slack zen chrome extension adds a couple really simple features to put you
back in control. See screenshot png files to see what this looks like.

- The favicon never has the red badge. If you want to check if someone sent you
  a message, go look at slack! There are times when that's suboptimal, but not
  worth the digital overload.

- Adds a "Toggle sidebar" button that...toggles the sidebar visibility. With the
  sidebar hidden, you can't see any information about unread messages, channels,
  etc. You can still start new messages with the compose icon or go to an
  existing channel/DM with cmd+k or the top search bar.

- When ever you click away from slack, the sidebar is automatically hidden. This
  makes it so you have to intentionally go to your other messages. Might give
  control over this in a future version where you can pin the sidebar open for a
  while or maybe not autoclosed the sidebar if you had just opened it in the
  last 15 minutes.
